End of 2020  
In late 2020, Théo (aka DevJ2K) discovered programming during 10th grade (equivalent to "seconde" in France), starting with Python. Fascinated by the idea of creating anything with just lines of code, this moment marked the beginning of his journey into software development.

Throughout 2021  
Throughout 2021, Théo (DevJ2K) worked on his first programming projects and explored new languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. During the same period, he also began learning 3D animation — a domain that quickly became a personal passion.

June 2022  
In June 2022, Théo (DevJ2K) completed his first fully functional project: a game developed in Python using Tkinter for a school assignment. Although the project had simple requirements, he appreciated the freedom to implement features beyond expectations and bring his own ideas to life.

October 2022  
In October 2022, after noticing that many students at his school used Discord, Théo (DevJ2K) had the idea to develop a Discord bot to help students access key information from the school’s intranet (schedule, homework, grades, etc.).  
This led to the creation of **EntOnDiscord**, one of his favorite projects. Through it, he learned object-oriented programming, web scraping, database management, and various backend concepts.

December 2022 – Group Project  
Théo (DevJ2K) completed a group project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. He contributed not only as a developer but also by producing all 3D assets (images and videos) and integrating them using Three.js.

December 2022 – AI Tic-Tac-Toe  
Also in December 2022, Théo (DevJ2K) began experimenting with AI by developing a simple engine to play Tic-Tac-Toe. Without relying on external libraries, the program learned from previous games and adapted its strategy to avoid losing and create winning moves.

December 2022 – February 2023  
During this period, Théo (DevJ2K) began learning mobile development with Swift and completed his first mission as a mobile developer. This experience taught him how to interact with clients, define requirements, and deliver solutions that meet expectations.

April 2023  
While continuing his personal projects, Théo (DevJ2K) passed his French high school specialty exams, achieving a **20/20 in Computer Science** and **18/20 in Mathematics**.

Summer 2023  
Théo (DevJ2K) traveled to the United States and spoke with various professionals in the IT sector. These interactions confirmed his desire to pursue opportunities in the U.S., where he believes the environment best matches his aspirations for growth and experience in the tech industry.

In September 2023
Théo (also known as DevJ2K) participated in the entrance exam for the 42 school, known as "La Piscine". This highly selective and intensive experience allowed him to meet new people, discover different learning methods, and challenge himself with increasingly difficult programming problems.

On November 6, 2023
Théo (DevJ2K) officially joined 42 Paris after successfully passing the entrance exam. The curriculum at 42 is divided into two main parts: the common core and the specialization. Théo began the common core, which is typically designed to take around 18 months to complete.

On March 22, 2024
After just 4 months and 16 intensive days, Théo (DevJ2K) completed the common core of 42 Paris in record time. This exceptional achievement made him the 5th fastest worldwide among more than 21,000 students across all 42 campuses. This milestone reflects both his advanced technical skills and strong personal discipline.
